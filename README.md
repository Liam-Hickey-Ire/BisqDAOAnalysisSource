# BisqDAOAnalysisSource

Source code used for the analysis of the Bisq DAO from a blockchain analysis perspective.

## Description

This project analyses the Biq DAO, specifically BSQ transactions, from a blockchain analysis standpoint. In performing this analysis, the project carries out the following functions:
- Extraction of Bisq peer-to-peer data using Protobuf (see, https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).
- Load LMDB data from an external closed source application.
- Collates Protobuf and LMDB data, pushing this combined data to a SQL database.
- Creates statictical graphs from SQL data using GnuPlot .
- Applies a Bisq DAO-specific address clustering heuristic to BSQ transactions.
- Retrieves 'tags' from Bisq DAO proposal transactions and Bisq Git Scraper

## Setup

#### LMDB

This project uses the LMDB files to load all BSQ transactions. These LMDB files are created using a closed source external application.

#### Protobuf

Google Protocol Buffers, otherwise known as Protobuf, is way in which serialised data is stored that is similar in some ways to JSON or XML. Bisq uses Protobuf to store data form its peer-to-peer network. This project extracts this data, to do this, firstly the Google.Protobuf NuGet package must be installed (see NuGet packages below) and then the Bisq protobuf class must be generated. To generate the Bisq protobuf class and allow the project to extract Bisq protobuf data, Protobuf must be installed (https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.17.1) and the class generated using the protobuf CLI.

The Bisq protobuf class can be generated by first extracting the Bisq.proto file from the Bisq source code (found here: ) and generating the class based on this .proto file. For an example on how to do this, see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/csharptutorial, but for a quickstart, the class can be generated using the following protobuf CLI command

`protoc -I=C:\filepath\BisqAnalyser\BisqAnalysisArtefact\BisqAnalyser\BisqAnalyser\Protobuf --csharp_out=C:\filepath\BisqAnalyser\BisqAnalysisArtefact\BisqAnalyser\BisqAnalyser C:\filepath\Protobuf\Bisq.proto`

Once the Bisq.cs protobuf class has been generated, ensure the class in placed in the project class directory (the same location as Program.cs), and add it to the project via Visual Studio or your chosen compiler.
